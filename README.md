# Craigslist_ML_project
I am implimenting machine learning techniques I have been learning over the past couple of weeks. This code will be able to catagorize rental property in vancouver, and the goal is to help people determine where they can live with what budget they have. Lastly I hope it will be able to find scams on craiglist and report them.
